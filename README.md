# KelleeBot - Twitch

This is a multi-purpose Twitch moderation chat bot written in Node.js and TypeScript. It connects to a MongoDB database that allows for storing of per-channel data (i.e., channel command prefixes).

It has a built-in feature that is able to auto-detect bot accounts and immediately bans these accounts from the channel. It also makes various API calls. For example, making an API call that will make the bot tell a random dad joke in chat.

**Note:** This is a re-write of the original version. The original version was purely written in JavaScript, while this one is written in TypeScript.
